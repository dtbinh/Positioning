    abstract = { Problems involving competition on networks play an increasingly important role in modern economies. This can be partially explained by the development of new technologies in transportation and telecommunications, which have favored the entry of firms offering customized products. For example, the increased variety in telephone services has led new companies to segment the market and to exploit specific niches. Furthermore many services have been privatized or deregulated in North America and in Europe (such as the airline industry, bus companies in many cities, truncking, energy, cable television and long distance telephone services), thus fostering the emergence of competition in new economic sectors. These problems have many facets which have begun to be analyzed in the operations research and economics literature, as shown by the expanding flow of papers dealing with the various dimensions of competition on networks. }

We derive variational inequality formulations of the governing economic conditions and establish existence and uniqueness results. A decomposition algorithm that exploits the network structure is proposed and convergence results given. The algorithm is then interpreted as an adjustment process to highlight the underlying economic behavior. Finally, numerical results for a variety of problems are presented. }

    abstract = { This paper presents a simple model of competition between transport firms that captures the interaction of system design, price setting, and consumer choice. Transport competition is modeled as a noncooperative game where firms first select network designs, then prices for transportation between any two nodes. The goal is to find a Nash equilibrium in prices and system designs for all competing firms. Competition is studied under two alternate assumptions about consumer choice: customers can bundle separately purchased legs and customers cannot. If bundling cannot occur, it is shown that unique Nash equilibrium prices exist and that each firm's profit can be written as the difference between two minimum cost flow problems. Sufficient conditions for the existence of equilibrium network designs are also developed. If bundling can occur, it is shown that a price equilibrium may not exist, and if it does, the price equilibrium may not be unique. Lack of existence or uniqueness implies that firm profit is not a well defined function of network designs. This shows that the network design problem with bundling is difficult. With bundling, some results are possible in the case of duopoly competition: an equilibrium in prices always exists but equilibrium prices may not be unique. However, when each firm chooses a network design to maximize the lower bound of its profit, the equilibrium network designs chosen are the same as those chosen when bundling is ignored. }

    abstract = { A model of duopolistic spatial price discrimination on a network is extended by adding capacity constraints on firms' outputs. With zero-one consumer demands, some configurations of capacity levels and locations do not have pure strategy Nash equilibria in price schedules, in particular when firms have some excess capacity but not enough to serve the entire market individually. An alternative to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in price schedules—the core of the market game among producers and consumers—is described and shown to have allocations corresponding to pure strategies for all location and capacity configurations. If both firms have some excess capacity, price schedules are identical to those in the uncapacitated problem. Equilibrium prices are no higher than the lowest prices in the mixed strategy Nash equilibria. }

    abstract = { This paper is a selective survey of the economic literature on the functioning of the markets where goods are subject to network externalities. Telecommunications, transports and computers give examples of markets where, for various reasons, these network effects appear. We first examine how the consumer's choices are affected by these network effects, as they are when switching costs are at work. On the markets of network goods, consumer's decisions depend either on the choices of previous generations, or on consumer's expectations, or both. The results are that choices may exhibit inefficiencies: a “wrong” good may be adopted because of the lack of coordination between individual decisions. We then turn to the study of a firm's strategies: when firms produce network goods, they may choose to make their product compatible or incompatible with the rival's good. Moreover, the nature of price competition is affected by the compatibility regime that prevails. This explains why consumers, who would always choose compatibility if prices were constant, might in fact prefer incompatibility if this regime intensifies price competition. In conclusion, compatibility choices by the firms and welfare implications are briefly examined. }
