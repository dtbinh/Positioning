# Why networks?

I will look a location behaviour on networks[^1].

[^1]: I will make an abstraction away from the linear ordering of customers, that characterise the 1D and 2D dimensional spaces. Eg. assume the dimensions are how much a person likes chocolate ice-cream and strawberry ice-cream. Peter is located at (1,0) indicating that he loves chocolate, but hates strawberry. Susan is located at (0.5, 1) indicating that she is indifferent towards chocolate but loves strawberry. I look at location behaviour on networks. Every person is different, but we share some preferences. In these networks each customer has a unique bundle of preferences, and close neighbours have one common preference.

[^1]: In these networks I assume that each customer has a unique bundle of preferences, and close neighbours have one preference in common. Customers will choose the closest firm measured in terms of common preferences. Instead of customers being uniformly distributed along every dimensions, the probability of every pair of customers being close neighbours is uniformly distributed (in the Erdős-Rényi random network).
