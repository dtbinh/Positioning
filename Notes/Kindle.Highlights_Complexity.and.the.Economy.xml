      <text>The economy is not necessarily in equilibrium; in fact it is usually in nonequilibrium. Agents are not all knowing and perfectly rational; they must make sense of the situations they are in and explore strategies as they do this. The economy is not given, not a simple container of its technologies; it forms from them and changes in structure as this happens. In this way the economy is organic, one layer forms on top of the previous ones; it is ever changing, it shows perpetual novelty; and structures within it appear, persist for a while, and melt back into it again.</text>

      <note>How do expectations enter computation? Is it possible?

Answer: 
There are different approaches. One approach is to led agents hold several hypothesis or mental models in the head at once, and then act on the one most credible. This differs from standard economic theory, in that expectations are not exogenous — i.e. you don’t assume a specific distribution and shared equation of motion that agents use predict the future. Instead you have heterogeneous agents with each their private expectation and mental model that influence how they act.</note>

      <note>Wikipedia: 
In machine learning and cognitive science, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a family of statistical learning models inspired by biological neural networks (the central nervous systems of animals, in particular the brain) and are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown. Artificial neural networks are generally presented as systems of interconnected &amp;quot;neurons&amp;quot; which send messages to each other. The connections have numeric weights that can be tuned based on experience, making neural nets adaptive to inputs and capable of learning.

For example, a neural network for handwriting recognition is defined by a set of input neurons which may be activated by the pixels of an input image. After being weighted and transformed by a function (determined by the network&#x27;s designer), the activations of these neurons are then passed on to other neurons. This process is repeated until finally, an output neuron is activated. This determines which character was read.</note>

It should be the probability of something like; getting a 1-bit adder followed by a 2-bit adder followed by … a 8-bit adder in 250,000 steps. Because the 1-bit adder, 2-bit adder, etc, are also on our list of “needs”. This conditionality would take the “probability cloud” surrounding each technology into account.
If the probability of getting this “conditional” combination is also negligible, then — and first then — could you say that the 8-bit emerged from the process, as opposed to the experiment being designed to discover it.

The model also confirms that the probability of randomly find a 8-bit adder is negligible. If the list of needs only contain the the 8-bit adder then the model does not discover it in 250,000 steps.

A 1-bit adder: 256 combinations
A 2-bit adder: ~10^14 combinations

      <note>Concept: “Factory discipline” — That new organisational sets of arrangements call for a new kind of person.

Somehow seems related to Webb’s theory of the “Protestant Work Ethic”. Although not with a focus on relegion, but highlighting that people from different cultures do not have “empty minds”, but bring with them their experience/psyche/discipline/work ethics from their previous organisational arrangements. May be interesting when considering Africa.
Also slightly related to Acemoglu and Robinson, although here the new political elite adopt the extractive economic and political system (organisational arrangement) from the previous elite (approach of colonial Spain in Central and South America).</note>

      <note>What if there are several markets and agents switch between markets. Ie. an agent trades/observes in one market, and then switches to the other market (randomly or deterministically). How do hypothesis in one market perform in other markets, and how do they affect the market? How does learning take place across markets? Will profitable strategies be spread to other markets by a single agent (the discoverer) or by different agents (the imitators)? Will other markets be immune to outside newly discovered profitable strategies? How quickly do markets “catch up”, ie. if a exploitive strategy spreads to a different (under-evolved) market, how long before other agents in that market developed strategies that are immune to this exploitive strategy?</note>
