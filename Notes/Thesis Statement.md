# Project Statement

How does price competition and product differentiation change when going from a duopoly setting and into the realm of oligopolies? And more particularly how does the *price competition structure* of oligopolies affect product differentiation and price setting. *Price competition structure* is here defined as a firms direct price competitors and the competitors of competitors and so on, until you have the full connected network of all firms present in the market. 

Hotelling (1929) introduced a model to understand and analyse the location problem (or product differentiation) and corresponding price setting of duopolies. Hotellings line market has long since been extended by Vickrey (1964) to a circular market with multiple firms (exogenous determined fixed entry costs determine the number of firms). However this model greatly reduces the *price competition structure* by restricting each firm to have exactly two direct competitors (one in the case of duopoly) and always being one single loop. The location problem has also been extended in a huge variety of other models, but relevant for this project is those that consider the firms location problem on a network. See Kress and Pesch (2011) for a review. In these, consumers are located on the vertices (and in some cases edges) of the network. The sequential competitive location models furthermore make use of a leader-follower game (which also excludes an analysis into the *price competition structures*) and assumes the network to be either chain-linked or a tree network (e.g. no loops).
 
**MY APPROACH** will be to a create a model based on a bipartite network – one group consisting of firm-vertices and one consisting of consumer-vertices. The location problem will consist of firms competing for edges (connecting them to consumers), of course taking other firms' choice into account. From the bipartite network and we can make an one-mode projection of the firm-group. The one-mode projection creates a new network representation where only the firm-vertices remain and the edges connecting them now represents direct price competition (e.g. an indifferent consumer, who in the bipartite network was connected to more than a single firm). The firms face a trade-off between maximising market share (number of edges to consumers) and minimising the number of indifferent consumers since these bring the firm into direct price competition with other firms.

The aim is to answer questions such as; are chain-linked structures preferable to network structures with loops or even cliques? What is the social optimal location strategy; lowest number of edges or a completely connected network? Will profit maximising firms choose the socially optimal? How will the structure of the network influence the price level? How robust are prices - how fast does prices changes travel across the network?

The project will be purely theoretically. Drawing heavily on linear algebra and microeconomic theory. Basic graph theory will be drawn from Newman (2010).
