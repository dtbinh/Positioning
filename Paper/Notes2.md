# Assumptions / Generalised

* __The space__
    * 1D line market (2D, n-dimensional, vertical and horizontal differentiation)
    * Bounded market / Hinterlands (Circle, distribution with non-closed support)
    * Uniform distribution of customers (Non-uniform, non-symmetric, distribution with non-closed support)
    * Euclidean space (Networks, ranking objective)
* __Number of firms__ 
    * Exogenous number of firms (Endogenous, simultaneous market entry/exit, sequential market entry/exit)
    * 1 facility per firm (Voronoi Game)
* __Transport cost function & distance function__
    * Linear transport cost (Concave)
    * 2D: Pythagorean distance formula (City-block, Infinity measure)
* __Firm behaviour__
    * Zero conjectural variation / no foresigt (Minimax strategies)
    * Constant marginal production costs
    * No cost of relocating
    * Occupy same location
    * Profit maximising (Firm preferred location)
* __Consumer behaviour__
    * Fixed demand (demand price/upper bound on price)
    * Inelastic demand (Elastic)
    * Homogeneous consumers (Heterogeneity) 
* __Pure strategies__ (mixed strategies)
* __Static game__
