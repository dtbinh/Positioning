# Literature review

The literature on spatial competition began with Hotelling's (1929) paper. Hotelling proposes a line market where consumers are uniformly distributed along the line and firms produce homogenous goods. Consumers inelastically demand one unit from the firm with the lowest price. The price is composed of the *mill price* and *transportation cost*. Each firm charges a *mill price* and customers bear a cost by going to the firm to shop. This *transport costs* is linear in the distance between the customer and the firm. Two firms decide where to locate and which *mill price* to charge. Firms first simultaneously choose their location, and thereafter simultaneously decide on their prices. There are two opposing forces that come into play; If the firm locates close to its competitor, it will attract more consumers. Meanwhile locating closer also lead to more fierce price competition from its competitor.

If *mill prices* are fixed and equal then there is no price competition and both firms locate at the center of the market and split the market equally. The agglomeration of firms has been coined *the principle of minimal differentiation*[^1]. The average distance travelled by consumers is one-fourth the length of the line. This is socially suboptimal. The social optimal location is where the market is split in two halves, with one firm located at the center in each of these halves. This reduces the average distance to one-eighth. 

[^1]: *The principle of minimal differentiation* was coined by Boulding (1955).

An error lead Hotelling to conclude that the model with price competition would also exhibit *the principle of minimal differentiation*. But when two firms are located in close proximity near the center, price competition drives down prices to a level where it is no longer optimal for firms to located inside the middle half of the line. The paper by d'Aspremont, Gabszewicz, and Thisse (1979) shows this and that no equilibrium exists in the model laid out by Hotelling. Instead they modify *transportation cost* to be quadratic in the distance between the customer and the firm, rather than linear. With this modification a unique equilibrium exist, but where firms locate at either ends of the line, ie. *maximal differentiation*. This shows how the *the principle of minimal differentiation* breaks down when price competition is introduced. 

The general results from 85 years of research since Hotellings paper is that conclusions and equilibrium are non-robut across alternative model specifications. Researchers have generalised the model, but most results are falsified when assumptions are modified. And even minor modification may remove any equilibrium constellations. _[One might then ask, why then does the model appeal to researchers and why the continued interest in the Hotelling model? (Paradime? Lack of alternative model/explanation?)]_

Below I will review some of the literature on the Hoteling model and more generally spatial competition models. I will present the reader with papers that relax the assumptions and generelise the Hotelling model. Biscaia and Mota (2013) find 352 published journal articles since 1979 that reference ‘Hotelling’ or ‘spatial competition’. So the sheer volume of research on this topic makes it is colosal task to provide at completely exhastive review. This literature review is not exhastive, but selective and focused on the literature relevant for this paper. 
The following papers will provide the reader with a more exhastive review of the topic; The early developments and historical development of the spatial competition literature is reviewed by Eiselt and Marianov (2011, chapter 1) and Smith, Laporte, and Harper (2009). Biscaia and Mota (2013) contain a bibliometric analysis of the literature. Eiselt (2011) provide a reissue of Hotellings orgininal paper with comments and references to later contributions. Graitson (1982), Brenner (2001), Eiselt, Laporte and Thisse (1993) provide literature reviews focused on the Hotelling model. While Kilkenny and Thisse (1999) and ReVelle and Eiselt (2005) give a more general review of spatial competition models. Daskin (2008) provide a review of discrete spatial competition models. Sequential location models are reviewed by Eiselt and  Laporte (1996) and Kress and Pesch (2012). And the review by Plastria (2001) focuses on the optimisation approaces to competitive location models.

## Space and number of firms

Eaton and Lipsey (1975) considers the line market and two-dimensional space. They asume fixed prices and investigates equilbrium with _N_ exogenous firms. 

Eaton and Lipsey (1975) prove analytically that no equilibrium solution exists when three firms have similar price. In the line market the two firms at each perimeter will move towards the centre, reducing the market of the third firm. Eventually this forces the firm at the centre to leap-frog to the outside. This process continues with the two outer firms again moving towards the centre. This has been refered to as *dancing equlibria* although no equilibrium exsist (Eiselt, 2011). In the line market with four firms, two firms will locate at one-fourth the length, and two firms will locate a three-fourths the length. Similarly in the case of five firms, two firms are located at one-fifth the length, two at four-fifths the length, and the fifth firm will locate at the center. The equilibrium ceases to be unique for six or more firms, instead it is a range of equilibria. If there is an odd number of firms, then one firm will be located at the center. The firms on the perimeters are paired. While the interior firms may be paired, or may be seperated by some distance. However no firm will have a market area less than one of the market areas on either sides of any firm (also refered to as the two *half-markets*). They conjecture that the *principle of minimum differentiation* should perhaps be replaced by *the principle of local clustering*, since pairs of firms choose to locate in close proximity to one another. _[Eaton and Lipsey (1975) also consider non unimodal and asymmetric distributions. Here they show that equilibrium requires that the number of firms in the market does not exceed twice the number of modes in the consumer density function. Ie. if the density is bimodal, then no equlibrium will exsists if there are more than four firms in the market.]_

They drop the assumption that firms behave without foresight (*zero conjectural variance*) and instead assume that firms adopt a *minimax strategy* where firms anticipate the entry of a new firm in the market. This leads firms to minimize the largest  *half-market*. If a firm locates at the center of its own market, rather than at the perimeters, then this minimises the firms exposure to new firms entering the market. With this behaviour firms will never locate in pair with other firms. Instead for any _n_ there exist a unique equilibrium where firms are evenly space along the line. And the equilibrium is socially optimal.

Shaked (1975) prove analytically that no equilibrium exsists for three firms locating in the plane. Eaton and Lipsey (1975, p. 40) note that it is not obvious how three or more firms will choose to locate in two-dimensional space, and write that *"using conventional analytical techniques the problem is very complex, perhaps intractable"*. Instead they use simulation techniques and once again assume that firms behave without foresight. Consumers are uniformly distributed on a disc, rather than a plane. They show that there exist a local equilibrium for a firm, where all firms are evenly spaced along a circle that has the same center as the disc, and which radius is less than the radius of the disc. However this is not a global equlibrium for the firm, and the circular configuration immediatly breaks up, since the firm will choose to pair up with one of its neighboors rather than remain fixed on the circle. Similarly for _n > 8_ where one firm is located at the center, and the remaining evenly spaced in a circular configuration. The firm at the center is in a global equilibrium, but the firms on the circle are only in a local equilibrium. Inaddition they show that no equlibrium exsits for firms located in a hexagonal pattern, square pattern or rectaglar pattern. Firms on the perimeter will pair up with neightbors, breaking the pattern. In sum they suspect that no equilibrium solution exists for three or more firms in two-dimensional space.

### Location problems

The Hotelling model belongs to a wider set of *competitive location models*, which again falls into the more generel realm of *location problems*. The differculty of finding optimal solutions is not restricted to the Hotelling model, but shows up in many other location problems. This subsection reviews looks more generally at location problems and optimal solution.

Problems that determine the location that minimizes the sum of distances from a firm or facility to its consumers is called *minisum problems*. A minisum problem on the continues plane is also known as *the Weber problem* (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011 chapter 1). The problem that determines the locations of multiple firms or facilies that minimise the sum of each firms distance to its consumers in a plane is known as the *multistore Weber problem* (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011 chapter 15). It is difficult since an allocation problem and a location problem must be solved simultanously. It has been shown that the computational differculty in solving this problem is *NP-hard*[^NP-hard], and thus heuristic approaches are required for large problems (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011, p. 336). Heuristic methods find good solutions, but do not gaurentee that the solution is optimal. 

A relative of the *minisum problems* is the *minimax problems*. In this problem the objective is to minimise the longest distance between a firm or facility and its consumers. On the continuous plane this problem is known as the *continuous 1-center*. And more genrally, with several firms, the *continuous p-center*. This problem minimises the longest distance between _p_ firms or facilities and thier consumers (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011 chapter 4). This problem resembels *set covering problems*. More specificly it is equivilant to the problem of covering an area with _p_ circles with the minimum possible radius (*cicle covering*), when there is positive demand at all points in the area. Masuyama, Ibaraki and Hasegawa (1981) show that this problem is NP-Complete[^NP-complete].

Thus finding the optimal solution is differcult even when disregarding the competitive aspects of location where firms interact with one another.

[^NP-hard]: In the field of computational complexity theory a distrinction is made between problems that can be solved in *polynomial time*, and those problems that cannot. A problem is said to be “easy” and “feasible” when it can be solved in polynomial time. A solution to a *NP-hard* problem may not be verifiable in polynomial time. *NP-hard* problems are at least as differcult as *NP problems*, and a solution to a *NP problem* can be vertified in polynomial time. (Ahuja, Magnanti and Orlin, 1988, Appendix B).

[^NP-complete]: A NP-complete problem is both a *NP problem* and *NP-hard problem*. That is the solution can be vertified in polynomial time, but no effecient method exists that can find the solution to these problems.

#### Voronoi diagram

In the fixed-price Hotelling model consumers will shop at the nearest firm. The market area of each firm therefore consists of all the consumers that are located closer to the firm than any of the other firms. Combining the market area of all firms result in a *Voronoi diagram* or *Voronoi tessellation*. A Voronoi diagram consists of several Voronoi set. Each Voronoi set has an associated *seed*, and each set contains all the points that are closer to the associated *seed* than any of the other *seeds*. For the Hotelling model the *seeds* correspond to the location of firms. _[The diagram can be constructed with different measures of distance, each resulting in a different Voronoi diagram.]_ Voronoi diagrams are geometrical constructions used to characterise allocation and studied for more than 175 years in different fields (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011 chapter 19). This subsection will review properties of Voronoi diagrams, and concepts that have arisen from the research on Voronoi diagrams.

The mean of a Voronoi set is refered to as its *centroid*. This point minimises the sum of distances to all other points within the Voronoi set and thus constitutes a local social optimal location for the firm. The *centroidal Voronoi tessellation* is a special case of the Voronoi diagram where all *seeds* or firms are located at the centroid of their set. A global social optimal solution is where firms are located such that all the market areas create a *centroidal Voronoi tessellation*. This minimises the average distance between consumers and firms and leads to an optimal “representation” or market allocation (Laver and Sergenti, 2011). _[In the one-dimensional line market the market areas created by two firms locating at repsectively one-fourth and three-fourth the length of the line constitues a *centroidal Voronoi tessellation*.]_ One method to generate a *centroidal Voronoi tessellation* from any generic Voronoi diagram is by using the Lloyd’s algorithm. The algorithm prescribes that at every iteration the firms or *seeds* should move to the current centroid of its Voronoi set. By iterating this proces a Voronoi diagram will converge to the *centroidal Voronoi tessellation*.

The dual of the Voronoi diagram is the *Delauney tessellation* (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011 chapter 19). This graph or network links *seeds* with adjacent Voronoi sets, where the length of the link is the distance between *seeds*. Reformulated in terms of firm location, the network links the firms that share a market boundary (ie. direct competitors), and the length of the link is the distance between the firms. _[In the line market with three firms, the Delauney tessellation will not link the two firms on either perimeter together, since they do not share a market boundary, however both these firms are linked to the firm in the middle.]_

In a bounded two-dimensioanl space, each Voronoi set is a polygon[^poly-distance]. The number of sides, the area and the peremiter of the polygon are measures that can be used to characterise the Voronoi set (Okabe, et. al. 2009). In terms of firm location these three measures would be the number of direct competitors, the market size, and size of the market boundaries. _[The latter is a proxy for the surface tension/energy of the market. The points on the market boundary exhibits higher energy than interior points.]_ While the properties of the polygon provide descriptive statistics on each firm, they contain less information on the intrinsic interaction between firms that is an integral part of firm competition. However the *Delauney tessellation* network provide insights on interaction. The number of direct competitors can also be obtained from the network by counting the number of links emanating from a firm. But more importantly the links tell which specific firms are in direct competition with one-another, and in a dynamic setting they tell how the competitive setting changes over time. As earlier noted, Eaton and Lipsey (1975) find that the hexagonal, square and rectaglar pattern break up because firms on the perimeter will pair up with neighbors. The *Delauney tessellation* provide an easy method to analyse such behaviour and perhaps a method to generalise the findings. _[The *Delauney tessellation* seem underexplored in the contemporary literature on competitive location of firms.]_

[^poly-distance]: Strictly speaking, the Voronoi set is only a polygon for certain measures of distance. A polygon is composed of line segments, thus the requirement is that the distance messaure results in the boundaries of Voronoi sets being line segments. The common distance meassues – Manhattan, Euclidean and Chebyshev – all fulfil the requirement (Eiselt and Marianov, 2011, chapter 19).

#### _[Voronoi game]_

Another thing that has arisen from Voronoi diagrams is the Voronoi game. This competitive location model shares features with the Hotelling model. In the Voronoi game two firms place _n_ facilities each and consumers shop at the nearest facility. The game is sequential so firms take turns and place one facility at a time. The game ends after _2n_ turns when both firms have placed all their facilities, and the winner is the firm with the largest market area. In the continuous line market the follower has winning strategy that captures _1/2+ɛ_ of the market area, however the leader has a strategy that can make _ɛ_ arbitrarily small (Ahm, Cheng and Cheong 2001). The two-dimensional Voronoi game is significantly more differcult to solve. In a one-round version of the Voronoi game where each firm place all its _n_ facilities in turns on a continuous square area, the follower still has a winning strategy, but the leader cannot make _ɛ_ arbitrarily small (Eiselt and Marianov 2011, chapter 9). And if consumers are distributed over a rectangular area that is suffeciently oblong, then it is the leader who has a winning strategy (Fekete and Meijer 2005). Fekete and Meijer (2005) furthermore show that the followers problem is NP-hard in the two-dimentional one-round game. 

### Space – Hinterlands, vertical differentiation and networks

The space on which customers are distributed influences results. As seen above moving from one-dimentional space to multi-dimensional space changes the equilibrium. Similarly the shape of the space (square, disc, rectangular) and whether the space is bounded or unbounded affects results. Depending on the shape and boundaries of the space there may exist *hinterlands*, that is remote areas or sparesly populated areas. Competing firms will find it less attractive to locate in these regions. Thus articles that consider spaces without natural hinterlands, such as the one-dimensional circular market, find that firms are more evenly spread (Eaton and Lipsey 1975, Salop 1979).

The models discussed so fare strictly consider *horizontal product differentiation*. Consumers have heterogeneous preferences regarding products or firms. The ideal point of the consumer is his or her location, and the ideal point of all consumers are ditributed over the entire space. Thus even when firms charge the same price, firms are able to archive some positive demand, through differentiation.There are niches that guarantee the firm a positive profit. This is not the case with *vertical product differentiation*, such as product quality where consumers are homogeous, ie. all consumers prefer high quality products to low quality products. If firms charge the same price, then the firm with the highest product quality will capture the entire market. No niches exists. The two-dimensional Hotelling model considers *horisontal production differentiation* along both dimensions. An alternative model is the Launhardt model (Ferreia and Thisse 1996). The model includes both *horizontal* and *vertical product differentiation*. It can be seen as an extension of the Hotelling model[^Launhardt], in that firms choose location, but firms have different delivery prices. The delivery prices is an easy way to incorporate *vertical product differentiation* into the model. Consumers still shop at firm with the lowest prices (*mill price* and *transportation costs*), thus all consumers prefer low delivery prices over high delivery prices. The Launhardt model is in a sense two dimensional, with each dimension respectively considering *horizontal* and *vertical porduct differentiation*.

[^Launhardt]: Although the Launhardt model extends the Hotelling,  the paper by Launhardt was published 44 years before Hotelling (1929) published his paper.

Another string of papers part with real space, and considers firm location or product differentiation in discrete space, such as on networks. 

Runco (2012) considers vertical product differentiation. Runco (2012) does not model products on a scale, instead he considers defines products as a bundle of characteristics. And two firms choose which of the _N_ characteristics to include in their product. The taste of consumers is given by a joint density function. They find that in equilibrium one firm’s product includes all _N_ characteristics, and that the degree of product differentiation between firms depends on the correlation between characteristics. Núñez and Scarsini (2014) also considers competition over a finite number of discrete locations. They find that an equilibrium will exsist when there is suffeciently many firms. And that as the number of  firms increase, the distribution of their locations converges towards the distribution of consumers’ preferences.

### Foresight

Prescott and Visscher (1977) critise the Hotelling model for its assumption of costless relocation. The hotelling model implicity assume that firms can always relocated at a future point of time at very low cost, and therefore firms, when they choose thier location, do not need to take account of future entry into the market. Instead they propose a sequential location model, where it is prohibitively expensive to relocate, and where firms therefore use foresight when choosing thier location *once-and-for-all*. Firm chose the profit maxisiming position subject to the position of firms already in the market, and the subject to the location rules that future rational entrants will use. Firms use backwards inductive reasoning, ie. the last firm firm will maximise its position given the position of all other firms already located in the market. The second last firm _n-1_ can use the position of all _n-2_ firms already located and the last firms best response to choose its location. And so on, firm _n-2_ use the position of the first _n-3_ firms and the best repsonse of firms _n-1_ and _n_. This continues all the way to the first firm.

Arthur (2014, chapter 11) is highly skeptial of this appoarch. Noting that there may be simple cases where every firm can figure out what to do, and where this appoach gives correct equilibrium predictions. But in more complicated scenarious or large problems with many agents the backwards inductive appoach is likely to break down. The approach requires sequential location and assumes *common knowledge* and *common knowlegde of rationality*. That is each firms knows the preferences of all other firms, and that each firm knows that all other firms knows the preferences of all firms, in an infinite regress. In addition each firms knows that all other firms behave rationally, and each firm knows that all other firms knows that all firms will behave rational, in an infinite regress. Further the optimal location must be unquie. If any firms is uncertain about the preference or rationality of an other firm, then the equilibrium solution breaks down. In essens when a firm has to choose its own location, the location of other firms is unknown. The firm can use the predicted location of the other firms. But the location outcome that each firm is trying to predict, depends on predictions that the firm and other firms form. *"Predictions are forming a world those predictions are trying to forecast"* (Arthur 2014, p.175). This self-referential loop leads to logical indeterminacy, and thus without some coordination device, the maximisation problem is ill defined and cannot be solved deductively. Nonetheless firms still make decisions even when faced with an ill defined problem. Firms possibly use heuristics or rules of thumb. Arthur (2014, chapter 11) discusses these issues in terms of a competitive location model, but does not propose a new location model that incorporates or overcomes the these limitations. Instead Arthur (2014, chapter 11) looks at a model on asset pricing, that share some of the same limitation, but is easier to solve since investors only need to predict a single measure — the stock price. Where as in the location model firms need to predict _n-1_ meauses – the location of all other firms. 

In the *Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market* discussed by Arthur (2014, chapter 11, chapter 3) investors are hetrogenous both in terms of information and the expecation models they use to predict the stock price. Investors holds several hypothesis on the expected stock price[^stock-price], all of which are based on the recent history of stock prices. They act on the hypothesis that suits the current state of the market and that has given most reliable predictions in the past. They continouesly discard poorly preforming hypothesis and form new hypothesis. Investors use *inductive rationality* rather than deductive reasoning prescribed by the rational expectations appoarch. More specifically, investors hold _M_ *predictors*, each with a corresponding linear forcasting model. Each *predictor* is a condition/forcast rule, such that if the current state of the market matches the conditions in the *predictor*, then the *predictor* is said to be *active*. Of all the active *predictors*, the investor then uses the linear forcasting model from the *predictor* that has been most reliable in the past. Thus investors are able to recognise patterns in state of the market, and act using their most reliable hypothesis. The state of the market is summerised by a 12-bit array. Each bit corresponds to a scenario, such as the *“the price has risen in the last 3 periods”* or *”the current price is not larger than 16 times the dividend devided by _r_”*. The combination of these 12-bits yield more than 4.000 different states of the market. The model uses a genetic algorithm[^GA] to create new hypothesis, so new hypothesis are created by “mutating” and “recombining” exsisting *predictors*. In each period when the actual stock price is reveal investors update the reliability of their hypothesis according to thier accuracy.  The stock artificial stock market is a agent-based model, where the investors are agents.

[^stock-price]: More precisly, Investors try and predict a linear combination of stock price and dividend. Dividend follows a stochastic autoregressive process, AR(1), which is unknown to investors. And the stock price is given by the market clearing price after investors have choosen between the risky stock and a risk-free bond with a fixed rate _r_, and investors have a constant absolute risk averse utility function.

[^GA]: …

### Agent-based modeling

Laver and Sergenti (2011) also construct an agent-based model. I will review thier methodology in this subsection. They use this model to investigate the competitive location behaviour of political parties on a two dimensional policy space. They argue that the policy preferences of voters in many countries can be reduced to 2-3 fundemental dimensions. 

To study multiparty competition they assume that political parties use heuristics or rules of thumb to determine their location. They have 5 different types of political parties or *species*. Each type of party uses one of the following heuristic:

* __Sticker:__ The party that sticks to its idealogical ideal point no matter what.
* __Aggregator:__ The party that constantly moves towards the center of its current voter base.
* __Predator:__ The party that moves towards its most successful competitor, trying to replicate its success.
* __Hunter:__ The party that continues to move in the same direction, if the the previous move proved fruitful, and otherwise heads in the oppersite direction.
* __Explorer:__ The party that surveys several directions and then move along the most lucrative.

The last two decision rules attempts to maximise market share directly. While the other decisions rules may maximise market share, but this happens indirectly.

The space that Laver and Sergenti (2011) considers is continoues and unbounded. They obtain this space by assuming that voters are drawn from a bivariate normal distribution. This also allows them to get two separate subpopulation of voters by varring the relative size, the means and the variances in the bivariate distribution. Thus their results on location behaviour can account for asymmetric and multimodal distributions. To simply they rotate the space such that the main difference between the two subpopulations take place along one of their dimensions. They call this the *main axis of policy disagreement* between the two subpopulations.

There is an exogeounsly given number of political parties in their baseline model and all parties are of the same type. Even their baseline model with an asymetric distribution has many free model paramenters, such as the number of firms, relative size, and polarisation of the means. The parameter space is huge so using a *grid search* technique to survey each and every parameter configuration is computationally exhausting. Instead they use a *Monte Carlo parameterisation* technique, that randomly draws a sample from the parameter space. They make 1,000 repeated draws from the parameter space.

In addition their model includes entry and exit of political parties.

Further note that none of these decision rules considers the simultaneous move of competing parties. They implicitly assume that other parties remain at their current location. And thus the decision rules are stripped of any and all strategic considerations and foresight.

### Recap

_Firm behaviour:_
This litterature reviews has look at different firm location behaviors. The simplest being firms with zero conjectural variation, ie. no foresight. With the minimax strategy firms forsee new entry or the relocation of exsisting firms in a manner that will cause a maximum damange to the firms market share, and the firm therefore locate to minimise this damange. However the minimax strategy does not consider whether the entry or relocation is a rational strategy or not for other firms, and  thus it leads to an inadequte concept of equilibrium. The ratational expectations appoach does consider this, but requires a sequential setup and very restrictive assumptions. In the field of asset pricing agents with *inductive rationality* is an alternative with more realistic assumptions. This paper will use *inductive rationality* to analyse firm location behaviour.

# Assumptions / Generalized

* __The space__
    * 1D line market (2D, n-dimensional, vertical and horizontal differentiation)
    * Bounded market / Hinterlands (Circle, distribution with non-closed support)
    * Uniform distribution of customers (Non-uniform, non-symmetric, distribution with non-closed support)
    * Euclidean space (Networks, ranking objective)
* __Number of firms__ 
    * Exogenous number of firms (Endogenous, simultanoues market entry/exit, sequential market entry/exit)
    * 1 facility per firm (Voronoi Game)
* __Transport cost function & distance function__
    * Linear transport cost (Concave)
    * 2D: Pythagorean distance formula (City-block, Infinity measure)
* __Firm behaviour__
    * Zero conjectural variation / no foresigt (Minimax strategies)
    * Constant marginal production costs
    * No cost of relocating
    * Occupy same location
    * Profit maximising (Firm preferred location)
* __Consumer behaviour__
    * Fixed demand (demand price/upper bound on price)
    * Inelastic demand (Elastic)
    * Homogeneous consumers (Heterogeneity) 
* __Pure strategies__ (mixed strategies)
* __Static game__
