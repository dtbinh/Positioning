The models discussed so fare strictly consider *horizontal product differentiation*. Consumers have heterogeneous preferences regarding products or firms. The ideal point of the consumer is his or her location, and the ideal point of all consumers are distributed over the entire space. 

Runic (2012) considers vertical product differentiation. Runic (2012) does not model products on a scale, but instead defines products as a bundle of characteristics. The two firms choose which of the _Q_ characteristics to include in their product. The preferences of consumers is given by a joint density function. They find that in equilibrium the product of one firm includes all _Q_ characteristics, and that the degree of product differentiation between the firms depend on the correlation between the characteristics. Núñez and Scarsini (2014) considers competition over a finite number of discrete locations. They find that an equilibrium exists when there is sufficiently many firms in the market. Additionally they find that as the number of firms increase, the distribution of their locations converges towards the distribution of consumers.

The firm can instead use the predicted location of the other firms. But the location outcome that each firm is trying to predict, depends on predictions that the firm and other firms form. *"Predictions are forming a world those predictions are trying to forecast"* (Arthur 2014, p.175). This self-referential loop leads to logical indeterminacy, and thus the maximisation problem is ill defined and cannot be solved deductively.

The latter two decision rules attempts to maximise market share directly, while in the former two the market share may be maximised, but only indirectly.

Additional firms do not push others further out, instead the *maxcov* firms locate within a rhombus shaped area that is centered on the population mean. 

Mean eccentricity only increases slightly as the number of firms are increased in the all-maxcov model. 

Two *maxcov* firms locate in the same fashion as firms using the aggregator rule.

_All-Maxcov mean eccentricity:_ For N=2 the firms using the hunter rule tend to locate fairly close to the population centre. While the firms using the maxcov decision rule locate farther away, and locate in the same fashion as firms using the aggregator rule. For N=2 this is the CVT. 
In the all-maxcov model there is only a slight increase in the mean eccentricity

The concentration of customers amoung firms is highly uneven in the all-sticker model. 
The most uneven concentration of customers is in the all-sticker model.

_All-Maxcov ENP:_ In a market with firms all using the maxcov decision rule, the firms tend to split the market share more evenly than with any of the other decision rules. Although the mean estimate is less than N for N>4. The standard deviation (confidence band) show that there are several runs where the market is evenly split among firms.

The results from this model therefore reflect how we choo ... As expected the mean eccentricity is 1.5 in the all-sticker model. This follows directly from the initial position of firms, which is drawn uniformly form a circle with center at (0,0) and with a radius of 3 standard deviations. The sticker firms do not move a thus the average distance to the population center is 1.5. 

The three other models show signficanly lower mean eccentricity. *Aggregator*, *hunter* and *maxcov* firms have the same initial posision as *sticker* firms, but they all move towards the population center. With the *hunter* firms locating closer to population center compared to *aggregator* firms. Firms that constantly search higher market shares locate closer to the center than firms that try and satisfy their current customer base. The distance to the center increases with the number of firms in both the all-aggregator and all-hunter model.

In the all-hunter model the firms agglomerate at the center. However not perfectly since the *hunter* firm never settles down, but constantly explores, which also shows in the confidence bands of the all-hunter. This creates the small perturbations away from the center. This perturbation is smallest when there is only two firms. _[As the number of firms increases, so does the total disturbances.]_ _[Additionally increaseing the number of firms crowds the center pushing other firms further out.]_

The board conclusions on the effective number of firms is the same for the all-aggregator, all-hunter and all-maxcov models. _[But there are small difference highlighting distinct aspects of each decision rule.]_ In all three models the market is evenly split when there are two firms present in the market. As the number of firms increase the the even split cannot be maintained. The effective number of firms increase slower than the actual number of firms.

With few firms the all-aggregator model results in a market that is more evenly split, compared to the all-hunter model. While the oppersite is true when there is more than 7-8 firms.

The all-maxcov model splits the market more evenly than any of the other models. And all though the estimated effective number of firms falls short of the actual number of firms already after 4 firms, the standard deviation (confidence band) show that there are always cases where the market is evenly split among all firms. This is not the case for the other decision rules.

We know that our all-aggregator model will maximise our mean representation measure, since the model results in the CVT.

*”there is some indeterminancy in the location of the firms (at least for some density functions)”*  (Eaton and Lipsey 1975, p. 36).
 Eaton and Lipsey (1975, p. 36) furthermore note that
*”When the number of firms is 2M, conditions ... require that the firms all be paired … When n < 2M, there is some indeterminancy in the location of the firms (at least for some density functions)...”*
The paring in the right panel of Figure 5.8 seems to support the first part of this statement.

_[Relate to Eaton and Lipsey (1975)]_
The change when going from 2-3 firms and into the realm of four or more firms seems related to an observation that Eaton and Lipsey (1975) made when considering asymmetric distributions. Although Eaton and Lipsey (1975) considered a vastly different setting, namely the bounded one-dimensional space (line market).

A high degree of polarisation amoung the subpopulation

With asymmetric distributions you have created 2 modes in the density of voters along the x-axis.

Eaton and Lipsey (1975) also considers asymmetric distributions in the bounded 1D space (line market). 
Might this be what gives a sudden change when going from 2-3 firms to 4 or more firms in the all-Hunter model?

You write that you experimented with more than two subpopulations. I am guessing this would give 3 modes in the density along the x-axis. With three subpopulations do you then observer a change going from 2-5 firms to 6 or more firms? Or does the big change still take place when going from 2-3 to 4 or more firms?

and as the 
symmetric distribution show

any degree of polarisation among the subpopulations make the *maxcov* firms seperate. In contrast, at a low or medium degree of polarisation ($0.5 < \mu < 1$) the two *hunter* firms agglomerate relatively close to the population center.

The slightly lower ENP in the *aggregator* model compared to the *hunter* model when there are many firms completely disappear when the subpopulations are polarised. 

A single firm or even two firms occupying one half of the market are likely to be attack by other firms.
However the in-fight competition in each subpopulation allows a small majority of firms to capture a disproportional amount of the market.
_[Image of all-maxcov uneven split, N=12 mu=1.5 n_r/n_r=1.]_

the two crowds are not necessarily the same size.

Looking at the ENP in the *maxcov* model the 
_All-Maxcov ENP:_ The more polarised the subpopulation is the more inequality among the market share of firms. What happens when $\mu$ is large, is that the subpopulations is split, and a minority of the firms often manage to capture one-half of the market. This pulls down the ENP.

The firm is endowed with $M$ number of hypotheses _[that together cover a wide range of different situations]_. Each hypothesis consists of two parts that jointly form a *condition/forcast* rule. The condition part specifies which situations trigger the forecast. _[Thus at every iteration the firm considers the hypotheses specific to the current state and ignores the remaining hypotheses.]_ To describe the current state of each firm we use a 13-bit descriptor. The descriptor $J_j$ summarises the location behaviour of firm $j$.

Each bit takes the value 1 or 0 -- the value 1 if the state occured and takes the value 0 if the state is absent. _[Eg. the 13-bit descriptor may look like `1110010011010`.]_

The tenth position in $J_j$ takes the value 1 when firm $j$ position along the y-axis is above the average of the last 16 periods. _[(along the dimension where the consumer subpopulations are in agreement).]_ Etc.

Essentially the firms locate in a market where they face competing firms.

Competitive location models are not limited to geographical locations. Location can be the characteristics of a product, a set of political policies, etc.

As hinted above the 

To study such type of competition a growing set of competitive location models have been developed.

Competitive location models are used to study such types of competition. 

In these models firms choose their location in a market where they face competing firms. These model are not limited to geographical locations. Location can be the characteristics of a product, a set of political policies, etc.

In the field of economics competition is often synonymous with price competition. However businesses compete with one-another on a multitude of other factors. Shops compete for customers when they choose their location. Manufactures compete when they choose product characteristic such as size, colour, and shape. Political parties compete for voters when they choose policies. Competitive location models are used to study such types of competition. In these models firms choose their location in a market where they face competing firms.

Hoteling’s line market was the first competitive location model. In this model 

As the subsequent literature review shows this model has been extended in terms of the number of firms, the distribution of consumers, and the number of dimensions.

therefore the agent does not take this into account when deciding where to locate.

Since my actions affects other agents, and I take this effect into consideration when choosing my location. 

The lack of foresight in the decision process of agents unfortunately implies the loss of strategic considerations. Strategic considerations that were fundamental to earlier competitive location models.

The sections also discusses how to solve and obtain results from the process that is independent of fore instance the initial position of the firms.

In addition the paper reintroduces strategic considerations into the competitive location model.
