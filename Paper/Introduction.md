In the field of economics competition is often synonymous with price competition. However businesses compete with one another on a multitude of other factors. Shops compete for customers when they choose their location. Manufactures compete when they choose product characteristics such as size, colour, and shape. etc. Models studying such type of competition are collectively known as *competitive location models*. The first was Hotelling’s line market, where two firms compete for consumers that are evenly distributed along one dimension. The model has been extended in numerous ways, such as the number of firms, the distribution of consumers, and the number of dimensions. The traditional approach analytically solves for the equilibria of the model. The conclusions then follow from analysing these equilibrium settings. Judging by the limited number of new insights discovered the last 15 years suggests that this approach might be reaching its limits. Biscaia and Mota (2013, p. 869) write that *“it would seem that most of the important features that justify the spatial behaviour of firms have already been explored”*. In addition it is proven that some location models -- despite being fairly simple in their setup -- belong to a set of problems suspected to be infeasible to solve. An alternative approach recently advanced in the political science literature relies on agent-based modelling. The location problem is set up a computer model in which the agents act simultaneously and according to a given set of decision rules. The model is analysed by running the simulation and observing how the interacting action of agents play out. The agent-based model allows researchers to study settings that are beyond the reach of the analytical approach, and to discover new insights, such as out-of-equilibrium and transitional location behaviour. In the current models the agents act using simple rules of thumb or heuristics without any type of foresight. And without foresight there can be no strategic considerations. That is each agent is oblivious to the future behaviour of the other agents and does not take this behaviour into account when deciding its own location. Strategic considerations are fundamental to the equilibrium concept of the earlier competitive location models. This paper uses the agent-based modelling approach, but reintroduces strategic considerations into model. The agent-based model from the political science literature is reformulated from one where *political parties compete with one another for voters when they choose policies* to one where *firms compete for customers when they choose location*. To institute strategic considerations the model uses decision rules that relies on inductive reasoning to forecast the future location of competing firms, ie. each firm holds several hypotheses on how competing firms behave which are used to make predictions. Firms learn through experience and adaption such that hypotheses are endogenous in the final model.

The paper is structured as follows. The literature review covers previous results from competitive location models such as Hotelling’s line market, its extensions, and the agent-based model. This section also covers research on related concepts that are used in later sections like Voronoi diagrams, distance metrics and various methods to implement learning in the model. The model and the various decision rules are introduced in the methodology sections. The section also discusses how to solve the model. This includes methods to determine *burn-in*, such that the results are independent of the initial position of firms, and methods to parameterise the model. The analysis section presents the results from various models and decision rules. These are gradually introduced starting with the simplest decision rules and distribution of consumers, advancing into asymmetric distributions, and finally covering the decision rules with foresight. The final section concludes the paper.
